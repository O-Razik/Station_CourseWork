# Station_CW
 This is my second year university coursework. There is an app for creating station timetables.
 My Course Work variant:
 # 13. Station
  No. Train | Initial station | End station | Intermediate stations | Time of departure | Time of arrival | Distance
  1) Use the merge algorithm to sort records by Distance.
  2) Determine the number of trains passing through the given station.
  3) Determine the average speed of the trains and sort by this parameter.
  4) Determine which trains depart from the specified station in the specified time period.
  5) Determine which trains arrive at the given station in the specified time period.
  6) Group records in which the final and intermediate stations coincide. // Still working on it
  For the class, create:
    1) Default constructor;
    2) The constructor with parameters;
    3) copy constructor;
    4) redefine operations >>, << for reading and writing to a file.
